  BMI is nothing but body mass index calculator:
  #start the programme
  To calculate BMI we take two inputs Weight and height.
  Now we will calculate value using the given formula and store in the variable(BMI) BMI= (Weight of body/height**2).
  After we use conditional statements for the further calculation
  if BMI<18.5 then we will print you are underweight.
  else if (elif) BMI<25 then we will print you are normalweight.
  else if(elif) BMI<30 then we will print you are slightly overweight.
  else if(elif) BMI<35 then we will print you are obese.
  else we will print you are clinically obese.
  #end of programme
  In this BMI_calculator.py we calculate Body Mass Index using the conditional statements.
